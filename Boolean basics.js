/*console.log(1 > 2);
  console.log(1 == 2);
  Boolean functions only in True and False.
  var score = 100;
  console.log(100 == "100"); Only value is considerate not the data type
  two equals sign works without taking consideration the data type but with three equals sign data type comes into consideration
  100 === "100" checks value as well as data type
  console.log(1 != 1); //false as 1 = 1
  console.log(1 !== "1");//true as 1 in double quotations is string.
